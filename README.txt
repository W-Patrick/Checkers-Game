-This is a checkers game I programmed. It is played by two human players.
-Player 1 is the set of pieces on top and player 2 is the set of pieces on the bottom.
-This version doesn't force the player to jump, however,I plan on editing this one so that it does.
-This version also doesn't declare a winner once a player has no moves to make. 
 (only when the player has a piece left, but is trapped in a corner or something of that sort. If a player runs out of pieces a winner is declared)
 I plan on fixing this issue ASAP.  
-I also plan on fully documenting the code in the future.
