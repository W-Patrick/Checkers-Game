-This is a checkers game I programmed. It is played by two human players.
-Player 1 is the set of pieces on top and player 2 is the set of pieces on the bottom.
-There are a few small details missing from the game but it is mostly played like a normal checkers game. 

-UPDATE: I am no longer working on this racket implementation of the checkers game.
